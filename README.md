## Demo

This example shows how to generate an error detection threshold map from any given image. All image distortions below the detected theshold will be barely visible to the human eyes.


```python
from model import *
import cv2

fname = "D:\Documents\PhD\LDR datasets\CSIQ\\1600.png"
img = get_luminance(cv2.imread(fname))
# Write the image here for easy comparisons
cv2.imwrite("tmp\\clean.bmp", np.uint8( img) )
plt.imshow( img,cmap='gray' )
plt.title("Luminance")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

Determining the visibility threhsolds. 


```python
qmodel  = model_deep_vis(load_weights=1)
fmap = qmodel.get_thresh(img)
fmap = cv2.resize(fmap, img.shape)
plt.imshow(fmap,cmap='jet')
plt.title('Thresholds')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

In the map above, information in areas of low visibility thresholds is easily seen by the human eyes and those in high visibility thresholds are difficult to see. Here, it looks like thresholds for the sky is around 1.5 and for the grass is around 4.

## Simple use case

We now demonstrate a possible use case of hiding some watermarks usign our approach. Let us add some simple messages (acting as distortions here) and scale the values to a maximum intensity of 4. Note that the 'distortion' here is the message as shown below.


```python
noise = np.mean( cv2.imread("tmp\\noiseadd.bmp"), axis = 2 )/255.0*4
plt.imshow(noise, cmap='gray')
plt.title("Noise added")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

Now we add this message to the original image and see the results.


```python
plt.figure(figsize = (10,10))
plt.imshow(img+noise, cmap = 'gray')
plt.show()
cv2.imwrite("tmp\\noisy1.bmp", np.uint8( np.clip(img+noise, 0, 255)) )
```

    True



Since the distortion was scaled to have maximum of 4 (more than the visibility threhsolds in the sky), it is visible; but distortion intensity of 4 is below the visibility theshold of the grass. So our message is not visible in the grass.

Now to hide the distortion in the sky, we can scale the noise to a value that is less than 1.5. And we can add this back to the original image.


```python
noise2  = np.mean( cv2.imread("tmp\\noiseadd.bmp"), axis = 2 )/255.0*1.5
plt.imshow(noise2)
plt.title("Noise added")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
plt.figure(figsize = (10,10))
plt.imshow(img+noise2, cmap = 'gray')
plt.show()
cv2.imwrite("tmp\\noisy2.bmp", np.uint8( np.clip(img+noise2, 0, 255) ) )
```

    True



Now the information in the sky is barely detectable.
